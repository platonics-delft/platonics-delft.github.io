    title="About the competition"
    subtitle="Robotics and automation promise to alleviate repetitive, dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks but often require an expertly engineered deployment to operate in the real-world. Versatile skills allow machines to operate autonomously and for longer periods allowing them to adapt to unforeseen situations which are currently resolved with direct human assistance or teleoperation. If we can program robots to solve problems by leveraging their previous experience, they can operate more independently and potentially be more effective. What should the core curriculum for robots to be successful in the real-world? This is what this event seeks to find out."
